 <img src="https://www.ajce.in/ch/images/dept_ch.jpg"></a>
 <P> The Department of Chemical Engineering started its meritorious journey in 2013, with the objective of moulding young minds with outstanding excellence in the field of Chemical Engineering and Technology.<BR>
 Equipped with a bunch of eminent faculty members, we have taken great effort to prepare our students to compete and contribute to the ever- changing world of technology. Apart from the focus on basic sciences and engineering subjects, we make sure that our students are good at problem -solving, analysing experiments and chemical process designing. In order to help the senior students in taking their studies a step further, we provide them accessibility to laboratory research projects, led by our faculty members, which often results in publications and presentations in national conferences. Right from the beginning, the department has emphasised on supporting and guiding students in making smarter career decisions by providing professional guidance and connecting them with prospective employers. Over the years, we have been able to 
 produce young engineers who are well- suited to capitalize on emerging career opportunities, and now, we hope to produce more in the coming years.</P>
