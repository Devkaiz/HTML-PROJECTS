 <P> The Department of Civil Engineering was established way back in 2006 and has been continuing its glorious journey ever since. In 2009 and 2014, we were proud to launch two M. Tech courses, which elevated our status to greater heights. The Dept.
 takes immense pleasure in delivering technically proficient and ethically responsible engineers to the society and promises to produce more for improving the living standards of our nation. Targeting the creation of best designers of the world’s infrastructure, we mould our gems with the skills of proper attitude and enthusiasm for the subject and provide a lifestyle harmonious with the environment.
The Dept. is also privileged to have an extremely dynamic and dedicated faculty whose expertise has been widely acknowledged. Civil engineers build the world’s infrastructure, which enables them to have opportunities galore with new players entering the market and large- scale developments announced around the globe..</P>
